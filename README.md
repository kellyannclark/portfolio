Overview
This web application is a personal portfolio project developed as part of my journey to enhance my software engineering skills. The primary goal is to showcase my technical abilities, projects, and personal achievements to potential employers and collaborators. The app features a responsive design, optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing, and includes several sections such as About Me, Projects, Skills, and Contact Information.

To start a test server on your computer, navigate to the project directory in the terminal and run npm run dev. Then, open a web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

The purpose behind creating this software was to consolidate my learning in React and modern web development practices, including the use of Vite as a build tool for a faster and more efficient development experience.

Web Pages
Home Page: Introduces visitors to the site with a welcoming message and navigation links to other sections of the portfolio.
About Me: Contains a brief biography, my professional goals, and a photo.
Projects: Showcases a list of software projects I've worked on, including descriptions, technologies used, and links to GitHub repositories. Project details are dynamically generated based on a JSON data file.
Skills: Displays a set of icons and descriptions for various programming languages and tools I am proficient in. Similar to the Projects page, this content is dynamically created from data files.
Contact Information: Provides a form for visitors to send me messages directly through the website, as well as links to my professional social media profiles.
The web app uses React Router for seamless transitions between pages without reloading the browser, enhancing user experience with fast, dynamic content updates.

Development Environment
The development of this software utilized Visual Studio Code (VSCode) as the primary code editor, leveraging its extensive ecosystem of extensions for code formatting, linting, and debugging. The project is built on React 17 and Vite, chosen for its simplicity and speed in bundling web applications. Node.js and npm were used for package management and script execution.

Programming Languages: JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3
Libraries/Frameworks: React.js, Vite
Tools: Visual Studio Code, Git for version control, and GitHub for repository hosting
